    <h1>ReportLatency Options</h1>

    <form>
    Report to: <i id="default_report_to"></i>
      <br>
      <input type="url" id="report_to" name="report_to" size="80">
    <br>

      This is where the services and their latencies are sent.  See
      the following options to determine how detailed the services are
      broken down.  localhost sends them only to your local machine,
      which would have to run it's own web service to capture them.

      <p>

	default_as_org
	<input type="checkbox" id="default_as_org" name="default_as_org"
	  value="false">
	<br>

	URLs are reduced to a service name to prevent security issues.
	The default service name '.' reflects the speed of the
	Internet as a whole, but by enabling <i>default_as_org</i>,
	the organization's domain name will be used if no other
	enabled rule is matched.  Examples: <tt>company.com</tt>,
	<tt>ci.city.st.us</tt>.  Only enable this if you're
	comfortable reporting the organization's domain names.
